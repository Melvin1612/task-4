//To compare two JSON objects in JavaScript without considering the order of their properties, you can follow these steps:
//Convert both objects to JSON strings using JSON.stringify().
//Compare the resulting strings for equality.
//Here's an example:

let obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age: 5 };
let obj2 = { age: 5, name: "Person 1" };

let obj1String = JSON.stringify(obj1);
let obj2String = JSON.stringify(obj2);

if (obj1String === obj2String) {
  console.log("The objects are equal.");
} else {
  console.log("The objects are not equal.");
}
//In this example, obj1 and obj2 are two JSON objects with the same properties, but in different orders. The code converts both objects to JSON strings using JSON.stringify(), and then compares the strings for equality using the === operator. 
//The output of this code will be: "The objects are equal".
//because the two objects have the same properties, regardless of their order.
